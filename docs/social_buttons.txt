Using Alternative Social Buttons with Nikola
============================================

:Version: 5.5.1+

.. class:: alert alert-info pull-right

.. contents::


The Default
-----------

By Default, the themes provided with Nikola will add to your pages a "slide in" widget at
the bottom right of the page, provided by Addthis. This is the HTML code for that:

.. code:: html

    <!-- Social buttons -->
    <div id="addthisbox" class="addthis_toolbox addthis_peekaboo_style
        addthis_default_style addthis_label_style addthis_32x32_style">
    <a class="addthis_button_more">Share</a>
    <ul><li><a class="addthis_button_facebook"></a>
    <li><a class="addthis_button_google_plusone_share"></a>
    <li><a class="addthis_button_linkedin"></a>
    <li><a class="addthis_button_twitter"></a>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="//s7.addthis.com/js/300/addthis_widget.js#pubid=ra-4f7088a56bb93798"></script>
    <!-- End of social buttons -->
    """

You can change that using the ``SOCIAL_BUTTONS_CODE`` option in your conf.py. In some cases, just
doing that will be enough but in others, it won't. This document tries to describe all the bits
involved in making this work correctly.

Part 1: ``SOCIAL_BUTTONS_CODE``
    Social sharing services like addthis and others will provide you a HTML snippet.
    If it is self-contained, then just setting ``SOCIAL_BUTTONS_CODE`` may be enough.
    Try :-)

Part 2: The theme
    The ``SOCIAL_BUTTONS_CODE`` HTML fragment will be embedded *somewhere* by the theme. Whether that
    is the correct place or not is not something the theme author can truly know, so it is possible that
    you may have to tweak the ``base.html`` template to make it look good.

Part 3: ``ANALYTICS``
    Some social sharing code requires JS execution that depends on JQuery being available
    (example: `SocialSharePrivacy <https://github.com/panzi/SocialSharePrivacy>`_). It's good
    practice (and often, the only way that will work) to put those at the end of ``<BODY>``

Part 4: assets
    For sharing code that doesn't rely on a social sharing service, you may need to add CSS, Image, or JS
    files to your site
